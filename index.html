<!--You're going to make a game just like the one in the video. Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. Put the following text on your page:

// Guess what letter I'm thinking of

// Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

// Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

// Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

//Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

//When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

//When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).-->

        //If user makes 9 guesses incorrect increase Losses by 1 and then restart game

        //If user makes guess same as computer increase wins by 1 and then restart game
